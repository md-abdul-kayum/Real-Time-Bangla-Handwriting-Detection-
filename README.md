----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I developed a Deep Learning model called "Real-Time Bangla Handwriting Detection" utilizing the EfficientNetV2 architecture. The system allows users to input handwritten Bangla characters through a paint canvas interface, where they can draw characters in real time. 

The model processes these inputs and predicts the corresponding character with high accuracy, making it a powerful tool for handwriting recognition. I evaluated the model's performance through various metrics, including accuracy and the relationship between batch size and accuracy. The results demonstrated the model's effectiveness and efficiency in recognizing Bangla handwriting, providing valuable insights into the capabilities of Deep Learning in practical applications.
